      normal directions
   *  Fixed locked points that where not scaled when the project units was changed to metric/imperal
      are correctly processed
   *  Corrected an error in the routine were imperial distances were translated into a text containing
      the number of feet and fractional inches. This error occurred when the value was negative but larger
      the -1.0 foot. In those cases the negative sign was omitted.

Version 2.0
Released October 06, 2005

   *  Added a database with FREE!ship designs to the website. These designs may be freely
      downloaded from www.freeship.org/designs Users willing to share their own designs are
      kindly invited to send their designs to designs@freeship.org

Version 1.91
Released September 08, 2005
   *  Major modification to the file format and file extension. FREE!hip models are from
      now on stored as binary files. This reduces the average filesize (and undo memory) to
      approx. 40 percent. This modification is done in preparation for web distribution of
      FREE!ship models (user database) and for the inclusion of a preview thumbnail in the file.
      The extension if the files is modified from .free to .fbm (Freeship Binary Model) Old
      files can still be imported but saving in the old FREE!ship file-format is no longer
      supported.

   *  Import and interpolate a surface defined as a number of curves in a textfile
   *  Curvature plot of intersectionlines

      manual section 2.2)
   *  Input relative values and imperial units in the controlpoint form (ref.
      manual section 2.4)
