   *  Drawing of leak points in a different color (ref. manual section 12.1)

Version 1.70
Released July 29, 2005
   *  Unfold Develop plates
   *  After auto-group of layers, the proper active layer is displayed
   *  When importing a .hul file, one new layer is created between two subsequent chines
      and one layer for faces which are added to close the hull at the centerline
   *  Store separate (last used) paths for import, export, save or load files
   *  Export stations to ArchimedesMB
   *  Implemented different shading modes

Version 1.65
Released July 14, 2005
   *  Set decimal seperator to a point.
   *  Fixed some minor points on .hul input
   *  Remember settings from hydrostatics dialog
   *  Fixed shading of underwaterview when the lowest part of the hull was not on
      Z=0.0 plane (height of waterline was incorrect)
   *  Model-check routine now also indicates location of leak points.
   *  Automatic model-checking can be swtched off in ptojectsettings dialog.
   *  When a new default model is started the user can also specify if the project
      should use metric or imperial units.
   *  Information exported to a DXF file is the same as what is seen on screen.
   *  3D translation of the entire model
   *  Mainframe location is also adapted when the model is scaled or moved
   *  Bug fixed that occurred when first a point was selected in a orthogonal view
      and secondly an edge was selected. The selected point then incorrectly moved
      to a new location.
   *  Manual add a new point in 3D space.

Version 1.60
Released July 7, 2005
   *  Export faces to wavefront .Obj format
   *  Changed capital characters in filenames to lowercase characters for Linux users
   *  Bug fixed which occurred when shading developable surfaces when the model exceeded
      the right side of the viewport
   *  Invert the normal direction of selected controlfaces
   *  Included user definable mainframe location in projectsettings
   *  Program preferences such as colors and controlpointsize can now
      be specified by the user
   *  Import a 3D bodyplan from textfile and fit a surface
   *  Export stations, buttocks and waterlines to 3D DXF file
   *  Export surface as 3Dfaces to DXF
   *  Import .hul files created with Carlson's freeware Hulls program
   *  Program performs an automated check for inconsistencies each time hydrostatics are calculated
   *  Bug fixed which caused incorrect length/beam waterline when interior edges started or
      ended exactly on the waterline at the calculated draft
   *  Export all intersections as offsets to a textfile.

Version 1.50
Released June 23, 2005 
   *  Fixed VRML import error, when all edges were set as crease edges
   *  Added metric/imperial units header to hydrostatics report when calculating multiple drafts
   *  Bug fixed which caused "spikes" on the surface after an undo operation
   *  Corrected memoryleak in undo-object data
   *  Mark layers as developable. Developable layers are shaded differently. Parts
      that have zero gauss curvature (thus are developale) are shaded green. Areas which are not
      developable are shaded red.

Version 1.40
Released June 22, 2005
   *  Save hydrostatics to richtext or plain textfile
   *  Import a VRML 1.0 file (for example from Hull program by Carlson design)
   *  Automatic removal of all controlfaces entirely on the starboardside of the hull
   *  Bug fixed, when deleting faces the remaing boundaryedges where set crease=true, but their
      start/endpoints remained regular vertices instead of creasevertices
   *  Rotate the model in 3D space
   *  3D scaling of the entire model
   *  Included wetted surface in hydrostatics
   *  Error messages are shown in hydrostatics
   *  Fixed bug that occurred when selecting controlpoints in viewports with a very high zoom ratio
   *  Made another modification to the fileversioning system
   *  Smoother zooming and panning
   *  Draw grid of intersections in profile, plan and bodyplan views
   *  Open email program or web browser when clicked on the hyperlinks in the startup/about screen
   *  Removed the Del-shortcut which caused selected items to be deleted when the delete key was
      pressed within the controlpoint form
   *  Implemented undo-function
   *  Calculate and output hydrostatic data for a range of drafts and trim

Version 1.30
Released June 14, 2005
   *  Draw normals of selected controlfaces when the visibility of interior faces is set to true
   *  Pan settings of the viewport are adapted when zooming in or out
   *  Implemented surface-analyzation to check for consistent and correct normal direction
   *  Interior edges descending from controledges are drawn slightly darker then normal interior edges.
   *  Implemented first simple hydrostatic calculations, based on surface panels rather then ordinates
   *  Switch between metric and imperial units
   *  Open file on double-click in windows explorer

Version 1.20
Released June 9, 2005
   *  Update the coordinate information of the active controlpoint in the controlpoint form
      when a point is being dragged with the mouse
   *  Included multiple project settings
   *  Shading of the underwaterpart in a different color
   *  Create a backup of old file when saving to disk
